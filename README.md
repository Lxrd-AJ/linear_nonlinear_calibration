# Linear and Non-Linear Calibration Methods
An implementation of Linear and Non-Linear methods for perspective camera calibration

TODOs
- [x] Linear method using SVD and QR decomposition
    - [ ] Needs refinement, see your notes
- [ ] Non-Linear method using optimisation techniques (Levenbergâ€“Marquardt method)
- [ ] [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org) for drawing the camera poses
